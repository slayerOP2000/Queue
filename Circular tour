Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. You will be given two sets of data.
1. The amount of petrol that every petrol pump has.
2. Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.
Find a starting point where the truck can start to get through the complete circle without exhausting its petrol in between.
Note :  Assume for 1 litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.


class Solution{
  public:
  
    //Function to find starting point where the truck can start to get through
    //the complete circle without exhausting its petrol in between.
    int tour(petrolPump p[],int n)
    {
       //Your code here
       int kamii = 0;//kaami ko starting mei 0 rkhliyaa hai
       int balance = 0;
       int start = 0;
       
       for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
           balance += p[i].petrol - p[i].distance; //balance ko maine petrol - distance kia
           if(balance < 0) {
               start = i+1;
               kamii += balance;//meri jo kami aayi thii maine wo store krali hai
               balance = 0;//balance waps update hogyaa hai
           }
       }
       
       if(balance + kamii >=0) //maine yaha pe dekha agr balance + kamii zadaa ajati hai 0 se toh return.
            return start;
        return -1;
    }
};
